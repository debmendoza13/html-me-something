<div> Hi! My name is Deb. I just returned from a trip to Ft. Lauderdale, Florida. I travelled with my boyfriend, my sister, and her 
daughter and two grandchildren. We spent time with my niece who lives in Miami. We visited the Keys and the Southenmost
Point. We went on an airboat tour and got to see crocodiles in the Everglades. We took a boat tour in Miami to see 
celebrity homes, the Miami skyline at night, and Star Island. We ate the best roasted chicken I've ever had at a Cuban
restaurant off of Ocean Drive in South Beach. We spent part of our last day at the beach. </div>
<br>
<h1> The Florida Keys </h1>
<p> The Keys are a string of islands that stretch over 120 miles south of the coast of Florida into the Atlantic Ocean
and Gulf of Mexico. The islands are connected by U.S. Highway 1, the only road between Key Largo and Key West. Key West 
is the southernmost city in the Keys, famous for the Southernmost Point, Hemingway's House, and Truman's Little White 
House. </p>

<h1> The Everglades </h1>
<p> The Everglades National Park spans 1.5 million acres and covers the majority of southern Florida. It is a wetlands 
preserve that is home to hundreds of animal species including the endangered leatherback turtle, Florida panther, and 
West Indian manatee. The Everglades is also home to plants and trees that do not grow anywhere else in the U.S. It is
also the largest remaining subtropical wilderness in the U.S. 
<br><br>
While in the Everglades we visited Gator Park, which offered airboat rides to glimpse alligators in the wild. (We saw
two!) After the airboat ride, we saw a presentation about alligators and crocodiles, with real alligators and crocodiles.
I even got to hold a baby gator! </p>

<br>
<h1> Miami </h1>
<p> There are several things to do in Miami. Boat tours, bus tours, museums, Ocean Drive, restaurants, the beach, etc. 
We chose the Historic Miami Skyline Tour and Homes of the Rich & Famous Sightseeing Cruise, a relaxing 90-minute boat 
tour with beautiful views of the Miami skyline at night. We also got to see Star Island, an exclusive island home to 
celebrities. There is one road to the island with a security gate and guest list. The island has its own police 
department and banks. 
<br><br>
We spent an afternoon at South Miami Beach across from Ocean Drive, a two-lane road with colorful hotels, condos, and
restaurants. It sprinkled briefly and scared many people off the beach. It was a windy day at the beach, but otherwise
the weather was mild and warm. </p>
